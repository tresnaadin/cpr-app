# Life Saver App
This app is a multimedia application for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) media learning.
I made this application as a final project in order to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and in making it I also worked with the Yayasan Jantung Indonesia as a provider of information content for the application.

## Tools
Tools that I used in this Project are:
1. Unity Engine - Main platform to make this multimedia app
2. Visual Studio Code - Code editor to code some action that used on this app (with C# Programming Language)
3. Adobe XD - Platfrom to make a design of Life Saver App

## Resource
